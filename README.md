# LBoL InGameMuseum
## Features
Lets you view the museum during a game run instead of just at the main menu.

## Configuration / Options
Default keybinding is `p`. This can be edited in the mod's config file. <br>
You can also **right click** the `Deck` while ingame to show it instead.

## Incompatibilities
Right click functionality on the `Deck` button is probably completely hijacked, so if any other mod needs that space, weird things are probably going to happen.
